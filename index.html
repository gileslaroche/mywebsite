        <p class="text">Giles Laroche has been drawing for as long as he can
          remember. "I especially enjoyed sketching the mountains, old farmhouses,
          and mill buildings which surrounded Berlin, New Hampshire, the town
          I grew up in." Giles fell in love with books at a young age.</p>
        <p class="text">Little did Giles know that when he grew up, other people
          would gaze at his books about faraway lands and that he would also
          travel to many of the places he would come to illustrate and write
          about in such books as <em>Bridges Are To Cross, Sacred Places, What's
          Inside? Fascinating Structures Around the World,</em> and <em>If You
          Lived Here: Houses of the World.</em> Whether Giles is exploring in
          Europe or hiking in New England, he always has a sketchbook in hand.</p>
        <p class="text">Sketches are only Giles' first step in creating the elaborate
          collages that Kirkus Reviews called "truly awe-inspiring." Every
          illustration involves many stages of drawing, cutting, painting, and
          gluing. Often, a piece has seven or eight layers before Giles is through
          with it!</p>
        <p class="text">Giles places spacers between each layer to give the final
          artwork added depth and dimension. He calls his technique "paper
          relief" because of its three-dimensional effect when photographed
          for inclusion in his books.</p>
        <p class="text">Giles lives and works in his house in Salem, Massachusetts,
          and in a 230-year-old barn in southwestern New Hampshire.</p>
        <p class="pullQuote">"As a child I enjoyed poring over maps, and
          reading and gazing at books about faraway lands - these are the books
          I enjoy creating for children."</p>
